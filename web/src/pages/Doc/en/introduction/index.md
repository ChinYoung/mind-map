This project can be used for learning and reference. Please deeply experience whether it can meet your needs when using it for actual projects.

This project may not have fully tested every function point, so there may be bugs. In addition, when the number of nodes is very large, there may be some performance issues. Because everyone can accept different levels of congestion, you can test the maximum number of nodes yourself.

If you have suggestions or find bugs, you can submit [issues](https://github.com/wanglin2/mind-map/issues) here.
